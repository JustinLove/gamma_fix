# Gamma Fix

Make the 3D game world more visible for HD5000 and perhaps other systems with dark video.  Separate mod required to fix strategic icons.

Applies gamma adjustment in post_copy shader.  Skybox doesn't appear to be affected by the darkness, so it had to be counter-adjusted.

Does not work with FXAA, and possibly other graphics settings.
